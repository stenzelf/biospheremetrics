# biospheremetrics


*The goal of biospheremetrics is to provide functions to calculate and plot 
the biosphere integrity metrics M-ECO and M-ECO in an R package based on 
outputs of [LPJmL](https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/lpjml/LPJmL_internal).*

## Installation

You can install `biospheremetrics` by git cloning this repository ...

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de:stenzel/biosphere_integrity_metrics.git
```

and install via  [`devtools`](https://rawgit.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/package-development.pdf) ...
```R
devtools::install("<path_to_pbfunctions>/biosphere_integrity_metrics")

library("biospheremetrics")
```

## Scripts

For now this repository also serves as a collection of PB calculation and optimization
scripts that are stored at `./scripts`  


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(boundaries)
## basic example code
